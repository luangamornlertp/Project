 abstract = {Most of the problems of analyzing survey data have been reasonably well handled, except those revolving around the existence of interaction effects. Indeed, increased efficiency in handling multivariate analyses even with non-numerical variables, has been achieved largely by assuming additivity. An approach to survey data is proposed which imposes no restrictions on interaction effects, focuses on importance in reducing predictive error, operates sequentially, and is independent of the extent of linearity in the classifications or the order in which the explanatory factors are introduced.},
