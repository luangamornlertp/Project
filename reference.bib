Indeed, increased efficiency in handling multivariate analyses even with non-numerical variables, has been achieved largely by assuming additivity. An approach to survey data is proposed which imposes no restrictions on interaction effects, focuses on importance in reducing predictive error, operates sequentially, and is independent of the extent of linearity in the classifications or the order in which the explanatory factors are introduced.},

 abstract = {Function estimation/approximation is viewed from the perspective of numerical optimization in function space, rather than parameter space. A connection is made between stagewise additive expansions and steepest-descent minimization. A general gradient descent "boosting" paradigm is developed for additive expansions based on any fitting criterion. Specific algorithms are presented for least-squares, least absolute deviation, and Huber-M loss functions for regression, and multiclass logistic likelihood for classification. Special enhancements are derived for the particular case where the individual additive components are regression trees, and tools for interpreting such "TreeBoost" models are presented. Gradient boosting of regression trees produces competitive, highly robust, interpretable procedures for both regression and classification, especially appropriate for mining less than clean data. Connections between this approach and the boosting methods of Freund and Shapire and Friedman, Hastie and Tibshirani are discussed.},

It is assumed that the learner has reason to believe that one of some pool of known algorithms will perform well but does not know which one. A simple and effective method, based on weighted voting, is introduced for constructing a compound algorithm in such a circumstance. It is called the weighted majority algorithm and is shown to be robust with respect to errors in the data. Various versions of the weighted majority algorithm are discussed, and error bounds for them that are closely related to the error bounds of the best algorithms of the pool are proved.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 30th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science}, pages = {256–261}, numpages = {6}, keywords = {error bounds, weighted voting, weighted majority algorithm, prediction algorithms}, series = {SFCS '89} }

 abstract = {A 'branch and bound' algorithm is presented for solving the traveling salesman problem. The set of all tours (feasible solutions) is broken up into increasingly small subsets by a procedure called branching. For each subset a lower bound on the length of the tours therein is calculated. Eventually, a subset is found that contains a single tour whose length is less than or equal to some lower bound for every tour. The motivation of the branching and the calculation of the lower bounds are based on ideas frequently used in solving assignment problems. Computationally, the algorithm extends the size of problem that can reasonably be solved without using methods special to the particular problem.},
