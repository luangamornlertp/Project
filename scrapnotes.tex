\subsubsection{Hedge/Weighted Majority Algorithm}
The \textbf{Hedge}, also known as the \textbf{Weighted Majority} \cite{wma} is an algorithm used to update the weighting of variables to decide which variable we should focus on when doing the next round $t + 1$. 
In our case, we use an adapted algorithm from Littlestone and Warmuth which Freund and Schapire called \textbf{Hedge($\beta$)} with the following distribution vector.
\begin{equation}
   \textbf{p}^t = \frac{\textbf{w}^t}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i^t } 
\end{equation}
Where $\textbf{w}^t$ is the vector of weights.
The following algorithm shows us how to update the Hedge($\beta$) after each turn:

\begin{algorithm}
\SetAlgoLined
\textbf{Parameters}:
\begin{description}
    \item $\beta \in [0,1]$
    \item Initial Weight Vector $\textbf{w}^1 \in [0,1]^n$ with $\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i^1 = 1$
    \item number of trials $T$
\end{description}
\For{$t = 1,\dots,T$}{
Choose Allocation \[ \frac{\textbf{w}^t}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i^t} \] \\
Incure Loss Vector $\ell^t \in [0,1]^n $ leading to loss $\textbf{p}^t \ell^t$ \\
Set New Weight to be 
\[ w_i^{t+1} = w_i^t \beta^{l_i^t}
\]
